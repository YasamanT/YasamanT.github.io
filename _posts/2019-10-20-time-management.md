Lately I've been runnung into the issue of time management. Because it's my first semester of uni it's hard to keep track of what you exactly need to do when nobody is there to tell you what,when and how you need to do your projects and studyings.So I Talked to one of the TAs about it and he had some interesting points. The TA said that there is no need to be stressed out and there is enough time to do everything I just need to plan things and I can do so by using tools such as Google calendar. And we also talked about getting a job while working and how with intermidiate knowledge one can still find a job, well not in an ideal company but it's still something specially for a broke student! Overall it was nice to learn  about a Junior's experience on university as a freshman!
