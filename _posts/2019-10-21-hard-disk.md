In this post I'm going to break down components of this Seagate hard disk model  ST31200N.(Of course as much as I can)
So before we get started, I just wanted y'all appreciate how ancient this piece is:

Yes it's almost 25 years old!!

So this piece is called Electronic circuit of Hard Drive. which all the important components such as RAM,Motor Drive,Controller,Flash Rom. But one Problem that i have with this piece is that there are sooo many different chipsts on this board that I couldnt really find out which one is what even thogh I searched the models and numbers! So stay tuned cuz I'm gonna ask TAs or our professor about it and then update this post.
