In this post I'm going to break down components of this Seagate hard disk model  ST31200N.(Of course as much as I can)
So before we get started, I just wanted y'all appreciate how ancient this piece is:

Yes it's almost 25 years old!!

So this piece is called Electronic circuit of Hard Drive. which all the important components such as RAM,Motor Drive,Controller,Flash Rom. But one Problem that i have with this piece is that there are sooo many different chipsts on this board that I couldnt really find out which one is what even thogh I searched the models and numbers! So stay tuned cuz I'm gonna ask TAs or our professor about it and then update this post.

These are permanent magnets help with spining of the access arm.

Although solid state drives (SSDs) will eventually replace all hard drives in time, the disk is a marvel of mechanical operation. The access arm moves at blazing speed across the surface of the platters.

Now compare it to SSD:

SSD is way smaller and lighter also faster.

This is called air filter that prevents HDD from dust and pollution and helps balancing air pressure of inside and outside. Fun Fact: inside a hard drive is actually pretty clean and sterilized.
This HDD was built in Singapore:

These are transfer wires:

So the Readwrite arm spins the platter so that the head of can read and write data on the disk.remember the head does not have physical contact with the platter, it writes and read information by magnetism.The data in the head is transfered to CPU by the thin transfer wires.

also just a bit of background about the company who built it:
